// Use this for configuration settings instead of scattering config "constants"

// !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   TO DO   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
// create data base and insert API address 

export const API_BASE = "!!!!!!!!!!!  insert API address !!!!!!!!!!";





// NOTE: the common approach is to set these values from environment variables
// and not to have the values "hard-coded" with the code.
// Then, you use the host or wherever the process is running to set the variables
// and you read them in here
// So if you do that it will look something like:
// export const API_BASE = process.env.API_BASE
